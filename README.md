# Bowling Kata ðŸŽ³

## Getting started

To build project run:

`npm install`

To test the project (will run in watch mode):

`npm test`

## Project details

This project will calculate the total score of a bowling game.
`bowling.ts` wil take a set of frame inputs as a string and output the total score.

This kata follows the guidelines in https://codingdojo.org/kata/Bowling/

### Some learnings

I definitely over complicated this kata by not reading the instructions. A set of assumptions were to be taken and not needed to be validated or intermediate frame scores were not necessary. So I started at the wrong place but a few days away from a laptop and re-reading the instructions and I started again and got something to the requirements.
